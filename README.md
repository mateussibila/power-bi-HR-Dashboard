# HR Workforce Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
Welcome to the **HR Workforce Analysis Project** repository!  
This project presents a business intelligence solution built with **Power BI, Power Query and DAX**, focused on analyzing workforce dynamics through interactive dashboards.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a business intelligence case study focused on workforce analytics for a medium-sized organization. The objective is to analyze HR data to understand employee dynamics, including headcount evolution, retention, and turnover across departments and roles.

The dashboard provides visibility into workforce trends, supporting data-driven decisions and highlighting patterns in headcount, retention, turnover, and hiring.
It addresses key business questions such as:

- How is the company’s headcount evolving over time?
- What are the current employee retention and turnover rates?
- Which departments and roles have higher attrition?
- What trends can be observed in hiring and employee exits?

## 📊 Data

The project is based on HR datasets containing information about employees, including:

- Employee demographics  
- Employment dates (hire and exit)  
- Departments and job roles  
- Employment status and organizational structure  

These datasets allow the analysis of workforce composition, hiring patterns, retention levels, and turnover behavior.

## 🔄 Data Preparation & Modeling

Data preparation and modeling were performed using **Power Query**.

The ETL process included data inspection, column standardization, data type adjustments, handling missing or inconsistent values, and creation of calculated fields for time-based analysis.

An **analytical data model** was then built by creating referenced queries, merging tables, and applying **dimensional modeling** principles, defining fact and dimension tables, establishing relationships, and validating cardinality.

This process ensured a clean, consistent, and well-structured semantic layer for analysis.

## 📈 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organized into three main analytical sections:

### 1. Headcount
This section provides a high-level overview of the workforce, including total headcount, active employees, and workforce evolution over time. It allows users to quickly assess growth or decline across departments and roles.

### 2. Retention
This section focuses on employee retention metrics, highlighting retention rates by department, job level, and demographic attributes. It helps identify how effectively the organization is keeping its talent.

### 3. Turnover
This section analyzes employee attrition, presenting turnover rates, exit trends, and termination patterns over time. It enables HR teams to detect critical areas with higher employee loss and potential organizational risks.
